# [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org) library for ESP8266/ESP32 and Arduino IDE

### English | [Русский](README_ru.md)

This library works with several types of APIs: [Current](https://openweathermap.org/current) (current weather only) и [Onecall](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api) (weather with forecasts).

To use it, you need the JSON parsing library: https://github.com/Bodmer/JSON_Decoder

This library is an improved version of [Bodmer's library](https://github.com/Bodmer/OpenWeather), which has more functionality, multiple bugfixes and optimizations. You can transfer your project from Bodmer's lib to this with minimal changes.
